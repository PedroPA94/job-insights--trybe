# Welcome!

This is my first Python project! It does some simple data analysis (max, min, filters) on job opportunities data and shows them on a Flask app (which wasn't developed by me). I also wrote tests for some functions using pytest.

This project was developed while studying Computer Science [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe). The files I worked on are in the ```/src/insights``` and ```/src/tests``` folders. I got approval on 100% of this project's requirements.

## Main languages and tools used

- Python
- Pytest
- Venv

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv` and start it with `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
- Run the project with `flask run`
- Run the tests with `python3 -m pytest` or `python3 -m pytest tests/filename.py`
